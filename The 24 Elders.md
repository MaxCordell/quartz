# Description
The 24 Elders are a group of figures mentioned throughout the book of Revelation. The elders often worship alongside the 4 Living Creatures but do have some noticeable differences.

_A notable correlation is that there were about 20 kings of Israel in the old testament. There is not much to back up the theory aside from the numbers seeming similar._

(Rev. 5:8-11) mention of Christ as their redeemer  
(Rev. 7:11-17) John uses the Greek word Κύριος (pronounced koo'-ree-os) meaning master
